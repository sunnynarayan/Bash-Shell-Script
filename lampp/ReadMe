What it does :
	* Creates a folder "mysqld" in /var/run
	* Starts the lampp server located in the /opt/lampp folder
	* Creates a link of "mysql.sock" file named "mysqld.sock" in the folder created in the first step.

What it solves : 
	* Mysql server of lampp has got problem to connect to other application like Django, Netbeans etc
	* To run, copy the start_lampp file anywhere on your system and write
		sudo ./start_lampp
	and press enter. It will ask for your sudo password. 
	* It is tested on Ubuntu ( can use on other linux OS if the file location is same).
